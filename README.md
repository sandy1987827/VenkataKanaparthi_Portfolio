### [Project 1: Model to Predict BodyFat](https://github.com/sandy1987827/DSC680-Applied-Data-Science/tree/main/Project1_BodyFatPrediction)

The terms “overweight” and “obesity” refer to body weight that is greater than what is considered normal or healthy for a certain height. Overweight is generally due to extra   body fat. However, overweight may also be due to extra muscle, bone, or water. This would impact the health and there are many other diseases caused by extra body fat. 
 
* Random Forest and Liner Regression Models were utilized
* Linear Regression Model is used since it was the best when it was compared with Random Forest
* This project created a model which predicts the body fat of a person based on parameters like height, weight, abdomen etc. 
* This can be used to determine whether the person is obese or not.

### [Project 2: Model to Predict Car Price of used cars](https://github.com/sandy1987827/DSC680-Applied-Data-Science/tree/main/Project2_CarPricePrediction)

New cars cannot be afforded by most of the people due to various factors, so all these customers opt for a used car with best features due to which the demand for used cars is always increasing. To stay in the market competition we should always offer a best price which is best to both to customer and the owner. The model we are going to create would help us in identifying the price of the car based the parameters that we would be passing would help us tag a better price on the car.

* Random Forest Regressor,Support Vector Machine - Regressor, Ridge Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet Regression were used
* Random Forest Regressor has best accuracy when compared with all other models.
* The model was implemented to predict the car price based on the dependent variables mpg, mileage, year etc.
