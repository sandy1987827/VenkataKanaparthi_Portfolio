### [Project 1: Model to Predict BodyFat](https://github.com/sandy1987827/DSC680-Applied-Data-Science/tree/main/Project1_BodyFatPrediction)

The terms “overweight” and “obesity” refer to body weight that is greater than what is considered normal or healthy for a certain height. Overweight is generally due to extra   body fat. However, overweight may also be due to extra muscle, bone, or water. This would impact the health and there are many other diseases caused by extra body fat. 
 
* Random Forest and Liner Regression Models were utilized
* Linear Regression Model is used since it was the best when it was compared with Random Forest
* This project created a model which predicts the body fat of a person based on parameters like height, weight, abdomen etc. 
* This can be used to determine whether the person is obese or not.
