#### [Project 1: Prediction of Body Fat](https://github.com/sandy1987827/DSC680-Applied-Data-Science/tree/main/Project1_BodyFatPrediction)

The terms “overweight” and “obesity” refer to body weight that is greater than what is considered normal or healthy for a certain height. Overweight is generally due to extra body fat. However, overweight may also be due to extra muscle, bone, or water. This would impact the health and there are many other diseases caused by extra body fat. We would be creating a model to predict the body fat based on some parameters. We would like to determine whether the person is obese or not in this project.
